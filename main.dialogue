"Hey! Imagine youâ€™re controlling an elevator that needs to stop at different floors. 
Instead of manually pressing the button for each floor, wouldn't it be great if you could automate it? 
That's where loops come in!"
"In coding, a loop is like a helper that repeats tasks for you. 
Let's use a simple example with a for loop."
Picture this: The elevator needs to stop at floors 1 through 5. 
Instead of pressing the button for each floor, a loop can handle it for you.

"Here's how it looks in JavaScript:

[code]
for (let floor = 1; floor <= 5; floor++) {
    console.log(`Stopping at floor ${floor}`);
}
[/code]"
=> END
