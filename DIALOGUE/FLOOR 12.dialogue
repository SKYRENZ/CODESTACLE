D: "Arithmetic Operators â†’ Perform calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`). "
D: "Assignment Operators â†’ Store and update values (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.). "
D: "Comparison Operators â†’ Compare values (`==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`). "
D: "Logical Operators â†’ Combine multiple conditions (`&&`, `||`, `!`)."
D: Let's put these into action!

D: \nlet a = 10; let b = 5;\nconsole.log(a > b);   // true\nconsole.log(a == b);  // false\nconsole.log(a <= 10); // true\n\n"
D: "Here, weâ€™re comparing values. Is 10 greater than 5? True! Is 10 equal to 5? Nope! We also check if 10 is less than or equal to 10â€”yes, it is!"

D: "Here, weâ€™re using logical operators! The `&&` (AND) operator checks if both conditions are trueâ€”since only one is, the result is false. The `||` (OR) operator checks if at least one condition is trueâ€”since one is, the result is true!"
