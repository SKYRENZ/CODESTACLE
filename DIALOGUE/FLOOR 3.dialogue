"JavaScript provides several ways to display output = console.log(), document.write(), innerHTML, and alert()"

"console.log('Hello, world!'); will display 'Hello, world!' in your browser's developer console. This is great for debugging and checking values while you code."

~ signage3
"document.getElementById('myElement').innerHTML = 'New text!'; changes the text inside the HTML element with the ID 'myElement'. Use this to update content on your web page dynamically."
=> END

~ signage4
"alert('This is an alert message!'); shows a pop-up box with your message. Use alerts to get the user's attention or show important information."
=> END

~ signage5
"document.write('Hello!'); writes directly to the HTML document. It's mostly used for quick tests or learning, but avoid it in modern web development because it can overwrite your whole page if used after loading."
